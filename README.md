## What is Ownible?

Ownible is a pioneering decentralized platform built on the **Chiliz Chain**, dedicated to tokenizing Real World Assets (RWA) from the vibrant worlds of sports and entertainment. It empowers fans to invest in, collect, and interact with digital representations of tangible assets they love.

Imagine owning a fraction of a classic album's rights, a piece of iconic sports memorabilia, or exclusive access to premier events—Ownible makes it a reality by turning them into tradable tokens.

## ✨ Core Features
